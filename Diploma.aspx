    </span></strong> <br />

The first three semesters emphasize the study of computer programming, operating systems, database and internet technology. The fourth semester of the CPD program exposes the students to data communication, security, advanced programming languages and the opportunity to select a professional option of their choice. Students with post-secondary education or work experience may apply for credits or challenge exams in related subjects. 

The CPD program provides students with the fundamental computer programming, Internet, and operating system skills required for programming related employment. In the first three semesters, the CPD and CPA programs share a common core of subjects. Students may easily transfer between programs. The CPD program provides students with a rigorous theoretical background in object-oriented methodology, particularly in program design and systems analysis. Internet concepts are integrated into all courses across the curriculum and focus on the development of dynamic database-driven web applications on a variety of operating system platforms. Small class sizes, computerized classrooms and an expert faculty provide an enabling environment for students to master the craft of programming and analysis. Opportunities will be provided for students to develop the individual and teamwork skills that are required to work in the fast paced world of business technology. Subjects studied will include programming and web scripting languages, system methodologies, E-commerce web site design, internet client and server side development, design and maintenance of database systems, data communications, security, and a variety of operating systems (Windows, Unix, Linux, IBM iSeries). General education subjects (English and Liberal Studies options) complement the technology curriculum.

    This program places emphasis on practical subjects and "hands-on" training delivered in specialty labs. These dedicated labs are configured for various environments such as Linux, Microsoft Windows, networking, OC hardware, Internet, AS/400, and RS/6000. Through these labs, students have access to stand-alone, clustered and networked PC's along with a host of LAN servers and mid-range computers. 

    <br />
    <br />
    Subjects studied include PC hardware, operating systems, Internet, HTML, Linux/Unix and Microsoft Windows Server administration, data communications, Novell Netware, AS/400 connectivity, web server installation, maintenance and security.

    <br />
    <br />
    Experience is gained using many vendors' products, for example, CISCO, Sangoma, Microsoft, Novell, and Rogers. Students have access to our fully equipped labs and open learning areas provide students time to practise their work. In addition, students have 24/7 access from external sites to Seneca's extensive computing services.
