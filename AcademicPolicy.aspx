    </span>

    <br />
    <br />
    At the end of each semester, and at other intervals as may be appropriate, the cumulative record of each student is reviewed by a Promotion Committee. The Committee officially represents the teaching faculty involved with the student. The Promotion Committee recommends to the College: the grades which shall appear on the Student Academic Record (transcript); the granting of Supplemental Privilege, the granting of Advanced Standing; the withdrawal of students from the College for reasons of unacceptable performance including protraction by more than a year of the normal time required for completion of a program, attendance or behaviour; the awarding of Seneca College Certificates and Diplomas upon satisfactory completion of subject objectives; other Diplomas upon satisfactory completion of subject objectives; and other matters regarding the academic progress and performance of each student. When the recommendations of the Promotion Committee have been accepted by the College and posted to an official transcript, they are considered final, subject only to the Appeals Procedure. Under no circumstances will grades be conveyed to a student other than by means of the official transcript.

<br /> <br />

    <span class="style18"><a name="2">Promotion Procedure - 1st & 2nd Semesters</a></span> <br />

    <br />
    At first and second semester promotion meetings, the promotion committee looks at the student's academic performance for the semester as an indicator of probable future success in the program. The student's academic record may also be considered in the context of written documentation which the co-ordinator would have received from the student. This documentation clarifies the circumstances that might explain lapses in a student¡¯s academic performance. (For example, lengthy hospitalization during the semester).At this level, academic performance and extenuating circumstances therefore become the criteria that guide the promotion committee in the application of the following policies:

    <br />
    <br />
    Any grade of DNC, DNA, or F entered on a student transcript is viewed as "NOT SUCCESSFUL" in a subject by the promotion committee.
 
    <br />
    <br />
    1. A student may be told to repeat the subject(s) for which the student received the F, DNC, or DNA grade(s) in the previous semester. A second unsuccessful attempt in a professional subject may result in the student being withdrawn from the full-time  program.

    <br />
    <br />
    2. A student may be withdrawn from the full-time program for up to two semesters if not successful in two professional subjects. Re-admission to the program depends upon successful completion of designated courses in an alternate setting with the minimum required grade of "B" to be attained.

    <br />
    <br />
    3. A student may be withdrawn from the full-time program if not successful in three or more semester subjects. Students are advised to consult with their co-ordinator or a guidance counselor to investigate alternate career paths.

    <br />
    <br />
    4. A student may be put 'on probation' for the next semester and/or recommended for a reduced course load due to a low grade point average (semester GPA <1.8). A student on probation is not being withdrawn; the student is being given the opportunity to improve academic performance. A student who fails to improve their academic performance while 'on probation' may be asked to withdraw from the program.

    <br />
    <br />
    5. Student transcripts are reviewed each semester.  Upon successful completion of a subject that was previously graded DNC, DNA or F, the unsuccessful grade is moved to a section of the transcript called "Not Applicable to the Current Program".

    <br />
    <br />
    6. The President's Honours List is a designation granted to those students who meet ALL of the following conditions in an academic semester:

    <br />
    <br />
    GPA of 4.0 (grades of A or better in all credit courses and SAT grades for all non-credit courses)
    <br />
    <br />
    Enrollment in first semester English or above (if part of the program)
    <br />
    <br />
    A curriculum course load for the designated semester (for example, students affiliated to Semester 1 of CPD must be registered in six subjects; students in Semesters 2 through 6 of CPA must be registered for five subjects)
    <br /> <br />

    <span class="style18"><a name="3">Promotion Procedure - 3rd Semester and Higher</a>

</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    At promotion meetings for the third semester and above, the promotion committee evaluates a student¡¯s academic record in the context of both academic history and written documentation which the co-ordinator may have received from the student. This documentation clarifies the circumstances that might explain lapses in a student¡¯s academic performance. (For example, lengthy hospitalization during the semester).

    <br />
    <br />
    At these levels, academic history and extenuating circumstances are considered by the the promotion committee in their application of the following policies:<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;1. Any grade of DNC, DNA, or F entered on a student transcript is viewed as "NOT SUCCESSFUL" in a subject by the promotion committee.<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;2. A student who is not successful in two or more professional subjects is evaluated on the basis of past academic history. The promotion committee may recommend one of the following:

that the student be placed on academic probation for the next semester
that the student withdraw from the full-time program for up to two semesters,
that the student be withdrawn from the full-time program
that the student be withdrawn from the School of Information & Communications Technology.
    <br />
    <br />
    3. A student may be told to repeat the subject(s) for which the student received the F, DNC, or DNA grade(s) in the previous semester. A second unsuccessful attempt in a professional subject may result in the student being withdrawn from the full-time program.

    <br />
    <br />
    4. A student who is not successful in two or more professional subjects after being readmitted to the full-time program or who is on academic probation may be withdrawn from the School of Information & Communications Technology.<br />
    <br />
    5. Student transcripts are reviewed each semester.  Upon successful completion of a subject that was previously graded DNC, DNA or F , the unsuccessful grade is moved to a section of the transcript called "Not Applicable to the Current Program".

    <br />
    <br />
    6. The President's Honours List is a designation granted to those students who meet ALL of the following conditions in an academic semester:

GPA of 4.0 (grades of A or better in all credit courses and SAT grades for any non-credit courses)
Enrollment in first semester English or beyond (if applicable to the program)
A curriculum course load for the designated semester (for example, students affiliated to Semester 1 of CTY must be registered in six (6) subjects and students in Semesters 7 and 8 of BSD must be registered for five (5) subjects).<br />

    * No student will be eligible to graduate with a Seneca College certificate or diploma if, in more than 30% of the subjects required for graduation, the student has received a"D" grade. For degree programs, no student will be eligble to graduate with an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) lower than "C+" (2.5 out of 4) or with an average in professional subjects lower than "C+" or with an average in non-professional subjects lower than "C" (2 out of 4).

    <br />
    <br />
    * In accordance with Seneca's Academic Policy mandating full disclosure on student transcripts, the transcript will display ALL subjects in which the student was enrolled.<br />
    <br />
&nbsp;* Students who take a mixture of day and continuing education subjects are advised to successfully complete at least 70% of the total required subjects for graduation during the day in order to be signed off as a day student. Exceptions are evaluated on an individual basis. Please see your coordinator.

    <br />
    <br />
    * Students who enter the program as direct entry students and are granted conditional advanced standings must successfully complete at least 50% of their subjects as a Seneca student.

    <br />
    <br />
    * Some FCE (continuing education) subjects that cover the same subject material as a day subject may not be counted towards a student graduation. FCE subjects that do not use the same subject code as the day program should not be considered acceptable until confirmed by a coordinator during the semester you are enrolled in the subject.

    <br />
    <br />
    * Students are expected to graduate with the program they started with. Any student that takes significantly longer than the six semesters used for an advanced diploma, four semesters for a diploma, eight semesters for a degree or two semesters for a certificate may be required to complete extra subjects that fulfill the current program requirements.</span></span><span class="style18"><span

    Students are responsible for reading and complying with directives appearing as comments on their academic transcript. A student who fails to comply with comment instructions may be asked to withdraw from the program. All comments are removed from the transcript at the time of graduation.

    When a particular program does not seem suitable for a student's skills and abilities, the student should consider transfering to another, more appropriate program. The sooner such transfers are done, the fewer credits that will be lost. Historically, for example, it is common for students to transfer between the CPD/CPA programs and the CNS/CTY programs after first semester, and since only one course is different between the two program streams, such transfer students lose only one credit. Similar transfers later on would result in more credit loss because the program streams diverge after first semester. Transfers from diploma to degree programs typically also result in some credit loss even if the content of the programs is similar, because the level of difficulty is typically higher in the degree programs. Students who feel that their current program is not suitable should consult with a program coordinator, to discuss the appropriateness, availability and transferability of other programs either within the School or elsewhere in the College.
